# Discord Activity: Getting Started Guide

My in-progress implementation of [this impostor game](https://github.com/simGOATed/Impostor) in Discord using the Discord building an activity template as a base. Currently struggling to implement a socket connection.

This template is used in the [Building An Activity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity) tutorial in the Discord Developer Docs.
